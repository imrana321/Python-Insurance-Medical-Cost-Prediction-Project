In this project, I analyzed a dataset of insurance data to build a predictive model for estimating individual medical costs based on factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The analysis involved data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing steps to understand the key drivers of medical costs. The findings indicate that smoking and BMI are significant predictors of higher medical expenses.
